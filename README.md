# kinesis-data-stream-addon

The `kinesis-data-stream-addon` module adds AWS Kinesis Data Stream access to a Sym runtime connector module.

This `Addon` will add a policy to the role generated by a `Connector`.

You typically include this `Addon` by adding `aws/kinesis-data-stream` to the  `addons` property of the runtime connector module, rather than referring to the policy ARN itself.

Kinesis Data Stream ARNs must be provided, as IAM policies for Data Streams cannot use wildcards with tags or resource names.

```hcl
module "runtime_connector" {
  source  = "symopsio/runtime-connector/sym"
  version = ">= 1.0.0"

  addons      = ["aws/kinesis-data-stream"]
  environment = "sandbox"

  addon_params = {
    "aws/kinesis-data-stream" = {
       "stream_arns" = ["arn:aws:kinesis:*:111122223333:stream/my-stream"]
    }
  }
}
```
